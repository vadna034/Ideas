# React Project Ideas
## Ledger To help me organize ideas
Very simple, and much doesn't need to be said as I have already made this page right here. Could include functionality for what I'm currently working on, and smaller To Do lists for projects that I am already working on

## What I'm watching
Develop an app to make it simpler to organize what you're currently watching. For someone like me who uses streaming sites that don't organize well, it would be helpful to keep that information in my head. As well, could expand this to many types of media, as there are movies I want to watch, read, etc, and I would rather not store that stuff just in my phone notes. 

## Study Buddies
Develop an app to allow students at the university of minnesota to network and easily form study groups. Could possible add forum capabilities for different classes and such. 

## Algorithm Visualizers
Graph algorithms are always cool to see. I should familiarize myself on other stuff and see if there are any that might be cool to create more concrete visualizations of.
